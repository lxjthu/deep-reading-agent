## 0. 摘要 (Executive Summary)
This paper examines how ecological product value transformation (EPVT) can be achieved through policy integration, using a case study of L City in Zhejiang Province. EPVT is theorized as a three-stage process: activating ecological resources, manifesting their value by linking ecological and economic systems, and transforming them into economic gains. The study finds that L City's 'policy combination punch'—a coordinated set of policies—enables this by integrating multiple policy tools, goals, and actors across formulation, implementation, and re-integration stages. Key mechanisms include creating a policy matrix, building action networks, and fostering continuous policy learning. The paper contributes to environmental governance by showing how dynamic policy integration provides structural, procedural, and motivational support for EPVT, offering practical insights for achieving sustainable development and green growth. However, the replicability of L City's model may be limited by regional differences in resources and institutions.

## 1. 选题价值 (Significance)
### 理论重要性
This paper is theoretically important because it addresses a critical gap in the literature on ecological product value transformation (EPVT). While existing research acknowledges the role of policy, it lacks a systematic, process-oriented analysis of how multiple policies interact dynamically to enable EPVT. The paper introduces and elaborates on the concept of 'policy combination punch' (政策组合拳) as a form of policy integration, linking it to the theoretical logic of EPVT ('value activation → value manifestation → value transformation'). It contributes to environmental governance and policy studies by providing a detailed, mechanism-based framework for understanding how coordinated policy systems can operationalize the 'Two Mountains' theory (绿水青山就是金山银山).

### 实践重要性
Practically, the paper addresses the real-world problem of the 'paradox of poverty amidst abundance' (富饶的贫困), where ecologically rich regions remain economically underdeveloped. It solves this by demonstrating how a coordinated policy system can transform ecological resources ('green content' or 含绿量) into economic value ('gold content' or 含金量). The insights from L City's case offer a replicable model for other regions in China and globally to achieve sustainable development, green growth, and common prosperity by institutionalizing EPVT processes, thus supporting national goals like ecological civilization and rural revitalization.

## 2. 情境全景 (Context & Background)
### 关键政策背景
- **“两山”理论 (Two Mountains Theory)**: Proposed by President Xi Jinping, emphasizes that 'lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets' (绿水青山就是金山银山). It underpins national ecological civilization strategies and guides EPVT initiatives.
- **生态产品价值实现机制试点 (Ecological Product Value Realization Mechanism Pilot)**: National-level policy initiated around 2019-2020, selecting pilot regions (like L City) to explore market-based and government-led pathways for EPVT. It is reinforced in the 14th Five-Year Plan and Party documents (e.g., 党的二十大报告, 二十届三中全会).
- **L市生态产品价值实现“十四五”规划 (L City's 14th Five-Year Plan for Ecological Product Value Realization)**: 2021 onwards, local policy framework in L City that systematizes EPVT efforts, marking a shift from exploratory to institutionalized phases with intensified policy integration.

### 关键现状数据
- **GDP and GEP Growth**: L City achieved sustained dual growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) since becoming a national pilot.
- **GEP核算完成 (GEP Accounting Completion)**: By end of 2019, L City completed GEP accounting at city, county, township levels, making ecological value quantifiable and explicit.
- **生态产品交易平台累计交易金额 (Cumulative Transaction Value on Ecological Product Trading Platform)**: As of August 2024, 684 transactions completed, amounting to 56.23 billion CNY, benefiting 1,303 village collectives with 700 million CNY in increased income.
- **盘活沉睡资产 (Revitalized Dormant Assets)**: As of 2024, 306.77 billion CNY of dormant assets were revitalized through EPVT mechanisms.

## 3. 文献源流 (Literature Stream)
- **演进脉络**: The field evolved from foundational work on the 'Two Mountains' theory, focusing on conceptualizing ecological products and their value (e.g., as including both natural and human-produced elements). Research then explored implementation paths, emphasizing multi-stakeholder participation (government, market, society) and mixed government-market approaches. Recent studies have begun to incorporate policy perspectives, highlighting the role of policy tools and institutional frameworks in facilitating EPVT, but often remain descriptive or fragmented.
- **主要争论**: Key debates include: (1) The balance between market-led vs. government-led pathways for EPVT, with a consensus leaning towards hybrid models. (2) How to effectively integrate ecological and economic systems to avoid 'resource curse' (资源诅咒) scenarios. (3) The optimal mix of policy tools (e.g., administrative, market-based, incentive-based) and how to coordinate them across different sectors and governance levels.
- **研究缺口 (Gap)**: The paper identifies two main gaps: (1) Lack of theoretical linkage between EPVT and 'policy combination punch' concepts, leading to theory-practice disconnects. (2) Insufficient analysis of the dynamic interactions and evolution among multiple policies in EPVT processes; existing policy studies are often descriptive or offer superficial recommendations without probing the essence of policy relationships and integration mechanisms.

## 4. 研究内核 (Core Content)
- **理论视角**: The paper employs a policy integration lens, framed within the 'Two Mountains' theory and ecological governance. It conceptualizes EPVT as a process involving 'value activation' (overcoming resource curse), 'value manifestation' (linking ecological and economic systems), and 'value transformation' (converting ecological assets into economic gains). This theoretical logic is operationalized through the case study of policy integration.
- **方法论**: Single-case study of L City in Zhejiang Province, selected for its adaptability (aligns with theoretical logic), typicality (origin of 'Two Mountains' theory, national pilot city), and richness (long practice period, diverse data). Methods include participatory and non-participatory observation, individual and group interviews with government officials (e.g., from Development and Reform Commission, Ecology and Environment Bureau), analysis of government documents and news, and field visits to counties and townships. Data triangulation is used to ensure validity.
### 核心机制/发现
The core mechanism is a three-stage policy integration process that enables EPVT: 1. Policy Formulation Stage: Creating a policy matrix that matches resources with development needs through targeted supply, nested goals, and bundled tools. 2. Policy Implementation Stage: Activating多元主体 (multiple actors) by integrating departmental functions, reconstructing responsibilities, consolidating resources, and transforming target groups into participants, thus building an action network. 3. Policy Re-integration Stage: Expanding channels through structural adjustments (vertical and horizontal integration) and policy learning (local and external knowledge absorption). This process provides structural, procedural, and motivational support for EPVT.

## 5. 洞见与启示 (Insights)
### 理论贡献
The key theoretical contribution is developing a comprehensive framework that links the abstract logic of EPVT (activation-manifestation-transformation) to the concrete mechanism of policy integration ('combination punch'). It advances policy studies by detailing how policy integration operates dynamically across formulation, execution, and re-integration phases to address complex environmental-economic challenges, thus bridging micro-practices with macro-theories in ecological governance.

### 反直觉/新颖发现
A surprising finding is that effective policy integration requires not just top-down design but also substantial bottom-up flexibility and local autonomy. The case shows that 'substantive' rather than 'nominal' integration—achieved through continuous adjustment, actor network building, and policy learning—is crucial for success, challenging assumptions that rigid, centralized policies alone can drive EPVT.

### 实践启示
Actionable advice includes: (1) For policymakers: Design hierarchical, coordinated, and flexible policy systems that integrate multiple goals (economic, ecological, social). Use a mix of policy tools tailored to different ecological product types (e.g., material supply, regulatory services, cultural services). Foster跨部门协作 (cross-departmental collaboration) and empower local governments with execution autonomy. (2) For practitioners: Engage in multi-stakeholder networks, leverage policy incentives (e.g., green finance, subsidies), and participate in policy learning processes to adapt EPVT strategies to local contexts. (3) For other regions: While L City's model is informative, adapt it selectively based on local resource endowments and institutional conditions rather than copying it wholesale.
