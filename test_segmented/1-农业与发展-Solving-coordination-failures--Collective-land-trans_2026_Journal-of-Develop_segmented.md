ABSTRACT
This study explores whether strengthening communal land rights can address coordination failures caused by 
fragmented land tenure. Based on China ’ s ambitious land reform that permits rural collectives to directly sell or 
rent their construction land to enterprises, we discover that collective land transfer rights boost rural entre -
preneurship by 25%. This positive firm growth is entirely concentrated in regions where collective coordination 
is simpler to achieve (i.e., less rugged areas and regions with denser clan networks). We identify two specific 
pathways behind the entrepreneurial growth: lower land use costs for firms and increased land wealth for local 
residents. The reform also facilitates expansion into non-farm wage employment, mainly due to more active 
participation in the labor market rather than via a decline in the agricultural sector. Our findings emphasize the 
importance of communal rights and collective negotiation in reducing coordination costs and offer new insights 
into promoting rural development in developing countries.

1. Introduction
Rural entrepreneurship is considered a promising pathway that al -
lows farmers to achieve self-sufficiency without having to leave their 
homes, yet its growth in developing countries is often disappointingly 
slow ( Banerjee and Newman, 1993 ; Gladwin et al., 1989 ; De Mel et al., 
2008 ). Apart from well-documented constraints, such as lack of 
agglomeration economies, limited market, and imperfect credit ( Asher 
and Novosad, 2020 ; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006 ; Gladwin et al., 1989 ), 
one foundational but less noticeable factor that impedes rural entre -
preneurship enthusiasm lies in fragmented land tenure and corre -
sponding high coordination costs ( Haasbroek, 2025 ; Isaac et al., 2016 ). 
This coordination failure, often termed the holdout problem, arises 
when property rights are clearly defined to multiple owners, making it 
costly to assemble land, especially the large, contiguous parcels required 
by modern enterprises, which necessitates unanimous agreement from 
numerous smallholders ( Foster and Rosenzweig, 2022 ; Kominers and 
Weyl, 2012 ; Strange, 1995 ). While state expropriation
1
is a common 
solution to this holdout problem ( Miceli and Segerson, 2007 ; Nosal, 
2001 ), the unconstrained executive power may undermining investment 
incentives ( Besley, 1995 ; Jacoby et al., 2002 ), and even trigger a new 
political holdout that erodes political trust and stall implementation 
( Kominers and Weyl, 2012 ; Sha, 2023 ). This dilemma therefore raises a 
critical question: is there an alternative property rights arrangement that 
can overcome the coordination failures impeding entrepreneurship 
without incurring high political costs?
China ’ s recent land transferability reform offers a potential 
communal rights solution by allocating land transfer rights to rural 
collectives. In China, there exists a dual land system, where urban land is 
state-owned, while rural land is owned by rural collectives. Unlike urban 
landowners, rural landowners previously lacked the discretion to 
directly transfer (i.e., sell or rent) their land use rights to enterprises 
unless the land was transformed into state-owned land through the local 
government ’ s expropriation. Given the unequal bargaining power in 
negotiations between farmers and governments ( Cai and Sun, 2018 ; Sha, 
2023 ), local governments typically provided meagre compensation to 
farmers whose agricultural land had been expropriated, while selling the 
land to real estate developers or industrial sectors at much higher 
market prices. This institutional arrangement infringed on farmers ’ and 
village collectives ’ rights to benefit from land ownership and triggered

land disputes and an informal (grey) land transaction market, which 
increases land use costs and uncertainty for enterprises considering in -
vestment in rural areas ( Jiao and Xu, 2022 ; Kominers and Weyl, 2012 ). 
To mitigate these problems, the State Council of China launched a 
landmark land transferability reform in 2015 that allowed rural col -
lectives in 15 counties to directly transfer long-term rural construction 
land use rights
2
to enterprises. This pilot program was expanded to 33 
counties one year later and eventually was rolled out nationwide 
through a modification to the legislation at the end of 2019. We utilize 
the staggered roll-out of this reform to examine whether the collective 
land transfer rights can solve coordination failures and promote rural 
entrepreneurship.
Theoretically, collective land transfer rights may resolve coordina -
tion problems in land assembly by allowing rural collectives to directly 
capture rents from land transactions. In contrast to the high transaction 
costs in state-led expropriation and fragmented individual rights 
( Haasbroek, 2025 ; Isaac et al., 2016 ; Miceli and Segerson, 2007 ; Nosal, 
2001 ), rural collectives can internalize the coordination costs through 
vote-based collective negotiation and lower external bargain costs by 
serving as a bargaining representative with firms ( Kominers and Weyl, 
2012 ; Ostrom, 1990 ). If this assumption holds, the reform is expected to 
spur rural entrepreneurship through at least two specific channels. First 
and more importantly, it may reduce land use costs for entrepreneurs 
who intend to invest in rural regions, especially those in land-intensive 
sectors, where land acquisition constitutes a large and unavoidable fixed 
cost ( Haasbroek, 2025 ). From an industrial organization perspective, 
rural collectives, as an additional land supplier, can break governments’ 
monopoly on the rural land market by supplying homogenous or even 
better assembled land parcels, which may lower the equilibrium land 
price given the effective competition ( Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007 ; 
Shapiro and Varian, 1999 ; Stahl, 1988 ). Second, successful dealings with 
land users allow farmers and village collectives to earn additional land 
income ( Dippel et al., 2020 ). This positive wealth shock can draw in new 
entrants either by providing start-up capital for local residents ( Cagetti 
and De Nardi, 2006 ; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989 ; Wang et al., 2012 ), 
raising demand for non-tradables, or enabling collective infrastructure 
investments ( Gan, 2010 ; Lettau and Ludvigson, 2004 ). Despite these 
potential benefits, it remains unclear whether they are substantial 
enough to overcome the preceding entrepreneurship barriers in rural 
regions—such as lack of agglomeration, market access, and imperfect 
credit ( Asher and Novosad, 2020 ; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006 ; Gladwin 
et al., 1989 ). The impact of this ambitious reform on rural entrepre -
neurship, hence, remains an open empirical question, which our study 
aims to address.
Our estimation strategy follows the staggered difference-in- 
differences (DID) framework, where we compare the number of newly 
registered rural firms over time between the treatment and control 
groups. A unique feature of the reform is that all the 33 pilot regions 
were selected from two representative reform lists in China: (1) National 
Comprehensive Pilot Program for New-Type Urbanization, and (2) Rural 
Reform Pilot Zones, which provide an ideal counterfactual group for 
causal inference. Our whole sample encompasses all towns within 666 
counties in China, where the treatment group consists of the towns 
located in 33 counties that were designated as the land transferability 
reform counties, while the control group comprises towns situated in the 
remaining 633 counties nominated in the two reform lists. Since the land 
reform was rolled out nationwide at the end of 2019, our sample period 
spans from 2009 to 2019, with policy shock occurring in 2015 or 2016. 
The advantage of our empirical setting is two-fold. First, our treatment 
and control groups are likely to share similar unobserved attributes as 
they were simultaneously nominated by governments for the same re -
forms ( Wang and Yang, 2025 ). We confirm their comparability based on 
careful balance tests in which no significant difference in predetermined 
socioeconomic factors can be observed between the treatment and 
control groups. Second, compared with using neighbors as the control 
group, our setting is less vulnerable to the challenges of the stable unit 
treatment value assumption (SUTVA).
The baseline findings show that towns in land reform counties 
observe a significant increase in the number of new firm registrations by 
approximately 25%, compared with the control group. More impor -
tantly, the growth of new firms is concentrated in regions with better 
collective coordination capacity (i.e., low-rugged areas and areas with 
denser clan networks) and is almost fully offset in regions where coor -
dination is more difficult to achieve. This growth pattern supports our 
core argument that the reform’s effectiveness hinges on solving the land 
coordination problem. By granting land transfer rights to rural collec -
tive, the transferability reform leverages the collective’s inherent ad -
vantages in internalizing transaction costs and overcoming coordination 
failures that often plague state-led or individual-based land transactions.
Our baseline results are robust throughout a range of validation and 
sensitivity tests, including an event study design to test comparable pre- 
trends and sensitivity checks with alternative control groups and esti -
mation specifications. One primary concern for our findings derives 
from other confounding policies enacted in rural China. To rule out 
these alternative explanations, we consider three main policies: (1) the 
nationwide Land Titling Reform aiming to enhance individual’s agri -
cultural land security ( Bu and Liao, 2022 ); (2) the Rural Returnees’ 
Entrepreneurship Supportive Program to support returnee entrepre -
neurs to engage in rural business, such as E-commerce; and (3) the Rural 
Housing Mortgage Program that improves credit access by allowing 
rural houses to serve as loan collateral. We first test robustness by 
including time-varying indicators for each of these policies as control 
variables in our baseline model. Across all specifications, the coefficients 
of our interest remain statistically significant, while those of the other 
policies are nonsignificant and small in magnitude. Apart from the static 
robustness, we go a step further by testing potential interactions to 
explore whether these policies act as complements or substitutes to the 
land reform. While the reform shows no synergy with the land titling or 
entrepreneurship support programs due to a mismatch in their policy 
targets (i.e., different land assets and different types of entrepreneur -
ships), we document a powerful complementary relationship with the 
rural housing mortgage program. Our findings highlight the potential 
synergic effects of relaxing frictions in both land and financial markets.
We next examine the growth pattern of rural firms regarding the 
industrial types, entrepreneurial quality, gender difference of entre -
preneurs, and spatial distribution of the new firms. First, our industrial 
heterogeneity indicates that the growth of rural firms is concentrated 
both in land-intensive heavy sectors such as manufacturing and mining, 
as well as a wide range of service industries, including retail, leasing, 
real estate service, research, education, and environmental manage -
ment. This dual-track expansion aligns with the previously established 
two specific channels: lower land use costs for firms and higher wealth 
for residents. We simultaneously observe a decline in agricultural en -
terprises, indicating that the reform regions are probably experiencing a 
structural entrepreneurial transformation away from agriculture ( Dippel 
et al., 2020 ; Fried and Lagakos, 2021 ). Second, the newly established 
rural firms appeal to have higher quality, evidenced by a shift towards 
more formal organizational structures, a significant entry of large-scale 
and long-term survival firms. Third, in terms of entrepreneur gender 
differences, the reform’s impact is not strongly biased at the aggregate 
2
Only rural collective operating construction land is allowed to be traded 
directly with firms. That is the idle rural construction land for industrial, 
mining, storage, commercial services, and other operational purposes specified 
in the predetermined general plan for land utilization and urban–rural planning 
in China ( Yan et al., 2021 ). In contrast, agricultural land that has already been 
allocated for farmers is in principle not permitted for direct transaction with 
enterprises. In some cases that must occupy such land to assemble a contiguous 
land parcel, rural collectives are mandated to follow China’s 
requisition-compensation balance policy (issued in 1999) by reclaiming an 
equivalent area of cropland elsewhere designated for construction.

level, but women disproportionately enter the service sector, while men 
enter both manufacturing and services. Finally, we observe a 
distance-decay effect: the entrepreneurial growth—driven primarily by 
the service sector—is larger in towns near the urban centers, suggesting 
the reform may simultaneously widen spatial disparities within a 
county.
Having established the causal impact on entrepreneurship and sug -
gestive evidence on growth patterns, we now formally test the under -
lying mechanisms. Our first and most important channel lies in the lower 
land use costs for enterprises given the emergence of competing rural 
land suppliers ( Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007 ; Shapiro and Varian, 1999 ; 
Stahl, 1988 ). As we cannot observe the transaction prices of collectively 
owned rural land, we investigate whether collective land transfer rights 
affect the transactions of state-owned land in rural regions. Specifically, 
we find a 19.4% decrease in state-owned land prices in towns within 
land reform counties. The price reduction is almost entirely driven by 
land-intensive industries that are more sensitive to coordination fric -
tions, such as manufacturing, mining, electricity, and construction, 
because land acquisition constitutes a large and unavoidable fixed cost 
for them ( Haasbroek, 2025 ). We observe no statistically significant ef -
fect on either the number of transacted state-owned land parcels or their 
total area. This null effect suggests a possible decline in fiscal revenue for 
local governments from state-owned land transactions.
Second, the successful land transfer to firms helps to convert illiquid 
land assets into realizable wealth for rural collectives and their mem -
bers. As illustrated before, this positive wealth shock can either directly 
encourage local farmers to start businesses or indirectly attract investors 
to rural regions, given the increased local demand and better business 
environments driven by wealthier collectives’ infrastructure in -
vestments. Our empirical evidence supports both direct wealth-driven 
and consumption-driven entrepreneurship instead of facility-driven 
entrepreneurship. Specifically, we observe a significant land income 
growth by 909 RMB per household—about 121% compared with the 
sample average. The growing wealth is significantly higher (about six 
times) for rural households living near urban centers than for their 
counterparts living in remote villages. More importantly, a consistent 
spatial pattern emerges for entrepreneurial decisions of rural residents 
who are allowed to share land revenues, while the impacts are negligible 
for residents with urban hukou, who are exposed to the same local 
conditions but are legally ineligible to share land revenues, given the 
institutional arrangements for collective assets allocation.
3
We also observe significant growth in rural residents’ expenditure on 
clothes and educational investments, which supports the consumption- 
driven entrepreneurship in the retail and education sectors. However, 
no evidence supports the idea that rural collectives systemically increase 
investments in infrastructure and public facilities following the reform. 
This limited impact can be understood from several perspectives. First, 
and most likely, rural households facing severe liquidity constraints 
often prefer direct cash transfers to in-kind or public provisions ( Cunha, 
2014 ). Moreover, the scale of the land revenue growth, while signifi -
cant, may simply be insufficient to fund costly, large-scale infrastructure 
projects.
Finally, we proceed to discuss potential reform costs and broader 
effects on rural employment. Our finding that the reform led to a decline 
in the number of newly registered agricultural enterprises raises a po -
tential concern: the observed entrepreneurial boom may have come at 
the cost of an agricultural recession. We formally test it through three 
distinct datasets: town-level satellite-observed cropland area, 
individual-level agricultural employment status, and county-level self- 
report agricultural outputs. Across all these indicators, the coefficients 
of land reform are statistically insignificant. This null effect is not 
beyond expectation, because our reform primarily targets collective 
operating construction land, which is legally and spatially distinct from 
the cropland allocated to households in pre-determined land use plan -
ning. Additionally, even in cases where land assembly requires the 
occupation of cropland, the village collective is mandated to follow 
China’s requisition-compensation balance policy by reclaiming an 
equivalent area of cropland elsewhere designated for construction. 
Recalling the decrease in state-owned land price and null effects on land 
quantities, the primary costs of land reform may lie in the decline of 
government direct fiscal revenue from state-owned land transactions. 
Moving beyond entrepreneurship, we show that the reform precipitates 
a broader transformation in the rural labor market by pulling workers 
into wage employment. This labor market expansion proves particularly 
beneficial for women, who are drawn from unemployment into local 
non-farm jobs, while their male counterparts are primarily shifted from 
agriculture.
Our work adds to the literature on the institutional determinants of 
entrepreneurship. Distinct from personality-based theory, which links 
the decision to become an entrepreneur with individuals’ attributes 
( Kihlstrom and Laffont, 1979 ; Levine and Rubinstein, 2017 ), this strand 
of literature documents a series of institutional frictions affecting 
entrepreneurship, such as access to capital, investment uncertainty, 
entry regulation, and legitimacy barriers ( Barwick et al., 2025 ; Hurst 
and Lusardi, 2004 ; Kim and Kung, 2017 ; Schmalz et al., 2017 ). Our work 
adds to this literature by identifying a foundational yet often overlooked 
constraint: the fragmented land tenure and corresponding coordination 
costs. We provide the first rigorous empirical evidence linking collective 
land transfer rights with rural entrepreneurship and specify the under -
lying channels from the perspective of land market imperfection and 
restricted land wealth.
We also enrich the understanding of property rights and develop -
ment. Grounded in the far-reaching theory of property rights ( Coase, 
1960 ; Demsetz, 1967 ; Hart and Moore, 1990 ), a large body of literature 
establishes the broad economic impacts of tenure security, such as the 
effects on agricultural investments ( Besley, 1995 ; Goldstein and Udry, 
2008 ), agricultural productivity ( Chen, 2017 ; Liu et al., 2023 ), labor 
supply ( Field, 2007 ), long-term well-being ( Xu, 2021 ), and housing in -
vestments ( Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2010 ). The study most relevant to 
our work is Bu and Liao (2022) , who investigate the effect of individual 
land titling on the growth of rural firms. We differ from their work in two 
aspects. First, we shift the focus from tenure security to the trans -
ferability margin of property rights. Our findings elaborate the argument 
that security alone does not guarantee efficient use: when rights are 
non-tradable, the secure and clearly-defined rights can yield factor 
misallocation by locking land into original inefficient landowners ( Jin 
and Deininger, 2009 ; Besley and Ghatak, 2010 ; Adamopoulos and 
Restuccia, 2020 ). Second and more important, we prioritize communal 
rights rather than individual rights. Unlike titling reforms securing in -
dividual land plots, our reform empowers collectives to negotiate 
contiguous land transfers. Our findings suggest that who holds the 
transfer rights—and at what level of aggregation—can be as pivotal as 
the right security itself.
Finally, our work ties to the literature on how institutional ar -
rangements can overcome coordination failures and holdout problems 
in the land market. A key barrier to rural development lies in the diffi -
culty of assembling fragmented landholdings for more productive, non- 
agricultural use ( Haasbroek, 2025 ; Isaac et al., 2016 ). Previous studies 
provide solutions from a variety of perspectives, such as contingent 
contracts ( Collins and Isaac, 2012 ), state expropriation ( Miceli and 
Segerson, 2007 ; Nosal, 2001 ), and site-development competition ( Isaac 
et al., 2016 ). Our study offers a novel institutional solution by allocating 
transfer rights to the village collectives rather than the individual. This 
solution is closely related to Kominers and Weyl (2012) , who theoreti -
cally suggest that collective decision-making may help alleviate the 
holdout problems. We build on their insights and provide empirical 
evidence that collective negotiation can lower land coordination costs 
3
In China, the collective land revenues are exclusively distributed among 
members who hold a rural hukou, while residents without a rural hukou, even if 
they live in the same villages, are not eligible to share the land-related revenue.

and therefore promote rural entrepreneurship.
The rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we briefly 
introduce China’s dual land system and the land transferability reform 
of our interests. Section 3 summarizes the data, sample area, and model 
specifications. We provide detailed empirical evidence in Section 4 and

2. Institutional background
China first established an urban–rural dual land market system in the 
late 1980s via constitutional amendments, wherein urban land is state- 
owned while rural land is owned by rural collectives. Only state-owned 
land is allowed to be transferred to individuals or enterprises within a 
specific period through a paid utilization system. Rural land, whether 
agricultural or idle construction land, is forbidden to enter the land 
market for non-agricultural use unless it is transformed into state-owned 
land through expropriation. This state-led expropriation approach is, in 
theory, a solution to the coordination costs of assembling rural land from 
numerous individual holders ( Miceli and Segerson, 2007 ; Nosal, 2001 ). 
However, in practice, it triggers a series of problems that erode political 
trust and stall implementation ( Kominers and Weyl, 2012 ; Sha, 2023 ).
During the land expropriation process, there is an inequality in 
bargaining power in negotiations between local governments and 
farmers or rural collectives, given the government’s capacities in an 
authoritarian regime and the ambiguous nature of collective property 
rights ( Cai and Sun, 2018 ; Sha, 2023 ). Local governments typically 
provide meagre compensation to the farmers or rural collectives whose 
agricultural land has been expropriated, while selling the land to real 
estate or other industrial sectors at much higher market prices. Based on 
the Blue Book of Analysis and Forecast of China’s Social Development
4
published in 2005, the original landholders, i.e., farmers and rural col -
lectives, only benefit from 5% to 10% of the increment in land value, the 
majority of which is instead captured by local governments and land 
developers. As a result, local governments have long been the sole 
monopolistic suppliers of industrial land, who are keen to promote 
rural–urban land conversion through land expropriation to earn huge 
profit margins ( Henderson et al., 2022 ).
The extremely uneven redistribution of land revenue between the 
government and farmers who lose land not only causes frequent con -
flicts and disputes in rural regions, but also triggers the emergence of 
informal markets or grey trading ( Hui and Bao, 2013 ). In the most 
extreme case, the entire village, including rural collectives and their 
members, could resist expropriation, leading to protracted negotiations, 
delays, and sometimes violent disputes ( Sha, 2023 ), which significantly 
increased the transaction costs for any potential investor. The dotted line 
in Fig. 1 shows how collectively owned land was traded in the past with 
enterprises. For an entrepreneur intending to start a business in rural 
areas, there were primarily two channels: (1) the formal chan -
nel—waiting for government-led expropriation—entailed purchasing 
land at high prices set by a state monopoly and enduring substantial 
bureaucratic delays; and (2) the informal channel, where transactions 
occurred outside the legal framework. While potentially cheaper, this 
path is subject to higher uncertainty because land can be taken back by 
local governments at any time. This institutional environment, charac -
terized by high coordination costs (either through the monopolistic state 
or the uncertain grey market) and insecure property rights, suppressed 
rural entrepreneurship due to the expensive and risky land to acquire.
To eliminate the institutional friction of the dual land ownership 
system and promote rural development, the State Council of China 
launched a landmark land property rights reform in 2015 that allowed 
rural collectives to directly transfer rural construction land use rights to 
enterprises in 15 counties. This pilot program was expanded to 33 
counties one year later and eventually rolled out nationwide through a 
modification to the legislation at the end of 2019. According to an 
interview with the minister of China’s Ministry of Land and Resources at 
that time,
5
the pilot counties were selected from the pilot region lists of 
two reforms: (1) National Comprehensive Pilot Program for New-Type 
Urbanization, and (2) Rural Reform Pilot Zones. Specifically, the selec -
tion of land reform counties is required to be representative across re -
gions with different development levels (i.e., balance eastern, middle, 
and western regions), which hence provides a reliable counterfactual 
control group for effective causal inference. We provide a detailed dis -
cussion of the coverage and implementation of these two pilot programs 
in Section 3.1.1 , and conduct a balance test in Section 3.3 to empirically 
demonstrate why these counties serve as a valid comparison group.
One unique attribute of this reform lies in allocating land transfer 
rights to rural collectives, which introduces a vote-based collective 
decision-making mechanism that can lower the internal coordination 
cost and a bargaining representative to coordinate with firms. The solid 
line in Fig. 1 illustrates this new process. Crucially, the decision to sell or 
lease land requires a formal resolution passed by a two-thirds majority of 
the members of the whole village (or their representatives). This col -
lective decision-making process effectively internalizes the negotiation 
among villagers, solving the potential for internal holdout problems. 
Instead of an external firm or government needing to negotiate with 
dozens of households, they now negotiate with a single, legally 
empowered entity, the rural collective committee, who possess an 
inherent advantage in consolidating land resources, given their au -
thority from de jure land ownership and legitimacy conferred by dem -
ocratic elections ( Martinez-Bravo et al., 2022 ; Zhao, 2020 ).
The revenue from the successful land transfer is first shared with the 
local government, which typically receives 20–50% as a land value- 
added adjustment fee.
6
The remaining revenue is allocated according 
to the collective’s charter: a portion is often reinvested into the collec -
tive’s capital fund for public services or saving for future development, 
while the rest is distributed to village members who hold a local rural 
hukou (household registration) as dividends. For example, in some 
counties, such as Wenchang in Hainan Province and Meitan in Guizhou 
Province, the remaining land income can be distributed among village 
collectives and members in a ratio of 3:7 ( Yan et al., 2021 ). Since the 
land revenue is exclusively distributed among members with rural 
hukou, we can expect that residents holding an urban hukou, even if 
they live in the same village and are exposed to the same local economic 
changes, are explicitly excluded from land revenue. This hukou-based 
distribution rule provides an ideal placebo group to isolate the effects 
of the reform-induced wealth from other confounding local factors. We 
will formally test this potential in Section 4.4.2 .
Since this reform supplemented, rather than replaced, the existing 
state land supply system, it actually changed the supply structure of the 
rural land market from a complete state monopoly to a duopoly of local 
governments and rural collectives ( Wen et al., 2022 ). It is worth noting 
that what rural collectives are allowed to trade directly is the long-term 
use rights (typically for 40–50 years) of a specific land category known 
as rural collective operating construction land (COCL). This kind of land 
refers to idle rural construction land for industrial, mining, storage, 
commercial services, and other operational purposes specified in the 
predetermined general plan for land utilization and urban–rural plan -
ning in China ( Yan et al., 2021 ). In China’s land use planning, rural land 
consists of two primary categories: (1) agricultural land, which includes 
cropland, forests, and grasslands; and (2) construction land, including 
homesteads for housing, land for public facilities, and the preceding 
COCL. Other idled construction land controlled by collectives is allowed 
to be traded with enterprises after being formally converted into COCL 
through the procedures of land use change. In contrast, agricultural land 
that has already been allocated to village members is, in principle, not

permitted to directly trade with enterprises. In some cases, where it must 
occupy such land to assemble a contiguous land parcel, rural collectives 
are mandated to follow China ’ s requisition-compensation balance policy 
issued in 1999 by reclaiming an equivalent area of cropland elsewhere 
designated for construction. This institutional restriction, in a way, helps 
to alleviate the concerns about the large-scale transfer of farmland to 
enterprises.
Some anecdotal evidence suggests that this reform brought evident 
benefits to village collectives and members. Firstly, they could acquire 
additional property income through direct transactions with land users. 
According to reports from the State Council of China,
7
the village col -
lectives and farmer members in the 33 pilot counties had earned a 
revenue of 17.81 billion yuan by 2018, which is equivalent to 35% of the 
total GDP of the agricultural sector in the Chinese capital, Beijing, 
during the pilot period. It is possible that the income growth induced by 
the land reform may encourage local farmers to become entrepreneurs, 
as suggested by the theory of initial wealth or start-up capital ( Cagetti 
and De Nardi, 2006 ; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989 ; Wang et al., 2012 ). 
Additionally, the formalized collective-led land market may have 
changed the rural land supply structure from a complete monopoly of 
local governments to competition between local governments and rural 
collectives ( Wen et al., 2022 ). The emergence of competitors can lead to 
strategic behaviors among different market players and reduce the 
equilibrium land price if the new supplier can provide homogenous or 
even better assembled land parcels. Despite these benefits, whether 
these potential benefits are substantial enough to overcome other bar -
riers impeding rural entrepreneurship — such as lack of agglomeration, 
market access, and imperfect credit — remains a key empirical question 
this paper seeks to answer.

3. Data, sample, and methodology
3.1. Data
Our work is primarily built on a combination of the following five 
datasets: the county-level reform roll-out agenda, enterprise registration 
records, residents ’ employment, income, and expenditure information 
from a nationwide survey, state-owned land transaction records, and 
other socioeconomic attributes.
3.1.1. Reform roll-out agenda
To construct our sample, we collect the county-level implementation 
agenda of the land transferability reform and the two other reforms 
mentioned in the background section from the official documents of the 
websites of the Chinese government. The first reform is the National 
Comprehensive Pilot Program for New-Type Urbanization, which was 
implemented across three batches from 2014 to 2018.
8
We utilize pilot 
counties only from the first two batches announced in 2014 and 2015 to 
align with the timeline of our treatment assignment. The second reform 
is the Rural Reform Pilot Zones, which selected a first wave of 24 pilot 
counties in 2012, followed by a second wave of 34 counties in 2014.
9
There is a total of 750 counties selected as the pilot regions for the two 
reforms, which we standardize to 2021 boundaries to ensure consistency 
with the aggregation unit of our firm-level data. We exclude 23 counties 
that exclusively permit individual towns within their jurisdiction to 
undertake the two reforms and 61 counties that, being fully urbanized, 
lack the town administrative units and therefore have no registered rural 
firms throughout the entire sample period. Our final sample covers 666 
counties, with 33 designated as the treatment group and the remaining 
633 as the control group.
3.1.2. Enterprise registration records
We measure our core outcome variable, rural entrepreneurship
10
, 
using the number of newly registered enterprises in each town by year. 
The raw data comes from the National Enterprise Credit Information 
Publicity System, which records detailed information on almost all le -
gally established business entities in China, such as the entrepreneur ’ s

The first batch was announced in December 2014, comprising 62 pilots at 
various administrative levels, including two provinces and a variety of cities, 
counties, and towns (See https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/site1/20150204/4020 
1423027629790.pdf ). The second batch followed in 2015, consisting of 59 
cities, counties or towns (See https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xxgk/zcfb/tz 
/201511/t20151127_963507.html ). The third batch was announced in 
November 2016, incorporating another 111 cities, counties or towns as reform 
regions (See https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-12/07/content_5144553. 
htm#1 ).
9
The county list for the first wave can be found in https://zqb.cyol.com/h 
tml/2012-01/13/nw.D110000zgqnb_20120113_2-03.htm , while that of the 
second wave is manually collected from individual pilot announcement issued 
by each respective provincial governments (See example http://m.sjmsw.org/H 
ome/News/detail/id/17860.html ).
10
There are two types of grass-roots administrative units in China: streets and 
towns. Streets are usually considered as urban areas because of intensive non- 
agricultural employment, while towns are considered as rural areas in a broad 
sense due to their sparse population. Following Artz et al. (2021) and the Eu -
ropean Commission (1988) , we define rural firms as firms registered in China ’ s 
towns, as these firms are more likely to be run by farmers or to sell products 
mainly for the rural market.
X. Lin et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Journal of Development Economics 178 (2026) 103609

name, enterprise name, address, registration date, industrial type, 
registered capital, scope of business, and operating status.
11
The un -
registered E-commerce and informal household businesses, whether 
agricultural or non-farm ones, are not captured by our dataset. We 
obtain the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each en -
terprise based on its address and merge them with a map of China’s 2021 
township administrative divisions, which allows us to aggregate the 
number of new firms in town-year cells.
Given that a large percentage of observations (approximately 45%) 
have missing industry information, we develop a machine learning 
technique that utilizes the term frequency–inverse document frequency 
(TF-IDF) vectorization method and the multinomial Naive Bayes algo -
rithm to predict a company’s industry based on its name. For each year, 
we train and validate the model on a subset of data with non-missing 
industry information and then apply the trained classifier to predict 
the industries for the unlabeled companies. To test for potential gender 
differences in entrepreneurship, we predict entrepreneurs’ gender from 
their Chinese full names using the open-source gender predictor based 
on a Naïve Bayes classifier ( https://github.com/jaaack-wang/gender- 
predictor ). This tool is trained on over 3.65 million names and ach -
ieves 96.2% accuracy on its test set. Our final dataset covers 11263218 
unique firms established in our sample counties between 2009 and 
2019. To mitigate the influence of outliers, we have trimmed the top 1% 
of the number of new enterprises established per town year.
3.1.3. China Household Finance Survey
We also use a nationally representative longitudinal survey, the 
China Household Finance Survey (CHFS, see https://chfser.swufe.edu. 
cn/datas/Home/HomeIndex ), to obtain additional employment and 
income information on rural residents. This survey, which started in 
2011 and has been carried out every two years, is one of the largest 
surveys on micro-level family information in China. Detailed informa -
tion about residents’ demographic attributes, such as gender, age, ed -
ucation, residential area, as well as their employment and consumption, 
is recorded in this dataset. We introduce an unbalanced panel sample by 
pooling all five waves of the CHFS from 2011 to 2019 and then matching 
it with our land reform roll-out information.
3.1.4. Land transaction records
To investigate the effect of collective land transfer rights on enter -
prises’ land use costs, we obtain state-owned land transaction records 
for rural regions from the official website of the land market ( https:// 
www.landchina.com/ ). The raw data documents the parcel-level trans -
action information, including land location, area, grade, total trans -
action price, land use type, land acquisition enterprise, industry, and 
transaction mode. We aggregate the average of parcel-level land unit 
price, total land area, and total number of land parcels at the town-year 
level. Given the particular sensitivity of land price to parcel location, we 
follow the random forest method of Grange et al. (2018) to isolate land 
quality and locational characteristics from land prices, which allows us 
to compare land prices between different regions more accurately. The 
detailed process can be found in Appendix A-2 .
3.1.5. Other socioeconomic attributes
Finally, we introduce a series of socioeconomic attributes to test 
predetermined differences between the treatment and control groups, or 
to examine potential aggregate effects. First, to test whether coordina -
tion capability matters for the effects of the land reform, we introduce 
two time-invariant indicators: (1) terrain ruggedness, which is sourced 
from the National Earth System Science Data Center; and (2) density of 
lineage genealogies from the Comprehensive Catalog of Chinese Gene -
alogies. The second type includes various pre-reform socioeconomic 
attributes obtained from satellite-based datasets, such as nightlight in -
tensity from the Harvard Dataverse, PM2.5 concentrations estimated by 
the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group, population density from 
the LandScan dataset, cropland area provided by Yang and Huang 
(2024) , and road density observed from the OpenStreetMap. Except for 
road density, which is only available since 2013, these variables are 
measured over the pre-reform period from 2009 to 2014. Third, to 
investigate the pre-reform balance on employment structure, we source 
the share of non-agricultural to total employment at the county level 
from the 2010 National Population Census. Fourth, we collect data on 
the output and planting area of major grain crops from County Statistical 
Yearbooks. The yearbook data, however, suffers from a high proportion 
of missing values (approximately 40%); we test whether this attrition is 
systematically correlated with treatment assignment in Appendix 
Table B-6 . We also introduce a panel dataset of points of interest (POIs) 
from Baidu Map, which we aggregate at the town-year level to test for 
changes in rural public facilities. Owing to the data access restrictions, 
the POI dataset spans from 2012 to 2017.
3.2. Sample
Fig. 2 shows our sample area, which covers all provinces in China. 
The treatment group consists of all towns located in 33 counties that are 
designated as the land transferability reform counties, while the control 
group comprises the towns situated in the remaining 633 counties that 
are selected as the pilot counties for the two reforms mentioned in the 
background section. We exclude all the streets in the sample counties 
because they are usually considered urban regions in China.
An advantage of our empirical setting is that it compares land reform 
counties with other runner-up counties that potentially would be 
treated, making our treatment and control groups highly comparable. 
Additionally, compared with using neighbors as the control group, our 
study is less vulnerable to the challenges of the SUTVA. Given that the 
land property rights reform was rolled out nationwide via legislation at 
the end of 2019, the sample period spans from 2009 to 2019, with the 
policy shock occurring in 2015 or 2016.
3.3. Balance test
To validate the ex-ante comparability of our treatment and control 
groups, we conduct a series of tests examining both the selection into 
treatment and pre-existing trends of key variables. First, we test whether 
observable predetermined county characteristics can predict the 
assignment to the land reform and its timing. The results are shown in 
Table 1 , where the outcome variable in Columns (1) to (3) is a dummy 
equal to one if a county was designated as a land reform county and zero 
otherwise, while that of Columns (4) to (6) is the year of the land reform. 
Following Feigenbaum and Gross (2024) , we regress the two outcomes 
by Probit and OLS models on a wide range of predetermined county 
characteristics, including nightlight intensity, PM2.5 concentration, 
population density, road density, cropland share, geographic location, 
and the pre-reform attributes of our primary outcome variables, the 
number of new rural firms and the share of non-agriculture employees. 
The selection of these characteristics is guided by insights from our 
communication with an official at the Beijing Municipal Natural Re -
sources Bureau, who indicates that the pilot selection is likely based on 
local economic foundations, land resource endowments, and agricul -
tural development levels.
Columns (1) and (4) introduce a panel dataset from 2009 to 2014, 
controlling for year fixed effects, while the remaining columns use a 
cross-sectional sample to include additional time-invariant variables. 
Across the six columns, we find that the pretreatment balance holds as 
we find almost no evidence that the land reform assignments are 
correlated with any of these attributes. One exception lies in the pre-

reform cropland share, which is marginally significantly higher for the 
earlier wave of reform counties (Column (5)). To account for potential 
selection bias, we incorporate heterogeneous trends of predetermined 
cropland share as control variables in our robustness checks.
Beyond testing for cross-sectional balance, we also examine the pre- 
treatment trends of time-varying covariates and our outcome variables. 
Appendix Figure C-1 plots the annual evolution of these variables for 
both treatment and control groups before the reform. We observe that 
the potential parallel trends hold for most of these variables, except for 
cropland share, which again shows a slightly converging trend between 
the treatment and control groups. The visually trends provide comple -
mentary evidence that our control group serves as a valid counterfac -
tual, reinforcing the underlying parallel trend assumption of our DID 
design.
3.4. Model specification
We exploit the staggered implementation of the land transferability 
reform across counties to identify the causal impacts on rural entre -
preneurship. Our empirical design follows the classical setting of a 
staggered DID (e.g., Liu et al., 2023 ), which specifies the baseline 
regression model as follows: 
Enterprises
i , c , t
= β
0
+ β
1
Reform
c , t
+ γ
p , t
+ μ
i
+ ε
i , c , t
(1) 
where Enterprises
i , c , t 
refers to the number of newly registered enter -
prises in town i of county c in year t . The independent variable Reform
c , t 
equals to one for the years in and after which county c implemented the 
reform and zero otherwise. γ
p , t 
and μ
i 
represent the province-by-year 
and town fixed effects, which capture the common shocks that 
happened in each year specific to each province, and the time-invariant 
characteristics of each town, respectively. ε
i , c , t 
is the error term, with the 
standard error clustered at the county level to allow correlation within 
the same county. The coefficient of our interest is β
1
, which indicates the 
causal effect of the collective land transfer rights on rural 
entrepreneurship.
To test whether the underlying parallel trend assumption holds for 
our DID estimator, we introduce an event study model and apply robust 
estimators developed in recent literature to deal with the heterogeneity 
of the treatment effect across counties and over time in the staggered 
DID model ( Borusyak et al., 2024 ; Callaway and Sant ’ Anna, 2021 ; De 
Chaisemartin and D ’ Haultf œ uille, 2020 ; Sun and Abraham, 2021 ). The 
event study model is specified as follows:

reference group and is omitted from the regression. Other variables are 
defined as in equation (1) . Our baseline analysis unit is at the town level. 
In our further mechanism analysis, we employ similar models to those in 
equation (1) but change the analysis unit to the individual, household, 
or county level to illustrate potential channels for the growth of 
entrepreneurship.

4. Empirical results
4.1. Baseline findings and the role of collective coordination capability
4.1.1. Baseline findings
Table 2 reports the baseline results, where the outcome variable of 
each column is the number of newly registered firms aggregated at the 
town-year level. All columns include town fixed effects and province-by- 
year fixed effects. Column (1) reports our preferred specification 
without any additional controls, while Columns (2) to (4) sequentially 
introduce interactions between predetermined cropland share — which 
we have observed pretreatment differences in our balance test — and 
linear, quadratic, and cubic time trends to account for potential 
differential trends across counties and avoid bias from bad control.
As shown in Table 2 , the coefficients of land reform are consistently 
positive and statistically significant at the 5% level across all these 
specifications. The magnitude also remains stable, with the coefficient in 
Column (1) suggesting an average increase of 33 newly registered en -
terprises in treatment towns, relative to the control group where the 
reform has not yet started. This growth is economically substantial 
(approximately 25%), given that the average number of rural enterprises 
per town is 132 in our sample. Overall, the baseline results suggest that 
the reform aimed at allocating land transfer rights to rural collectives 
promotes the growth of rural entrepreneurship.
4.1.2. The role of collective coordination capability
As we have emphasized in the background section, the collective 
land transfer rights we study differ fundamentally from the individual 
rights in their capacity to solve the land coordination failure. We thus 
infer that the effectiveness of this reform may hinge on the collective ’ s 
pre-existing coordination capacity. A collective with strong coordina -
tion abilities can more easily aggregate fragmented plots and negotiate 
with investors, thus amplifying the reform ’ s effects. In contrast, where 
coordination is difficult due to geographic or social barriers, the re -
form ’ s impact should be muted.
To test this core precondition, we exploit regional variation in two 
proxies for a collective ’ s coordination capability: terrain ruggedness and 
clan networks. The results, presented in Table 3 , provide strong, com -
plementary evidence supporting our hypothesis. First, we use the stan -
dardized minimum terrain ruggedness
12
of each county as an inverse 
proxy for coordination capacity, as consolidation is inherently more 
costly in topographically complex areas ( Nunn and Puga, 2012 ). Column 
(1) introduces a dummy variable which equals one when a county ’ s 
standardized ruggedness is above the sample mean and zero otherwise. 
The coefficients show that the reform ’ s positive effect is concentrated in 
low-rugged areas and is fully offset in highly rugged terrain where co -
ordination is difficult to achieve. The continuous interaction in Column 
(2) further implies: a one-standard-deviation increase in ruggedness 
reduces the reform ’ s impact by a substantial 23 firms. These results 
show direct evidence that geographic barriers, which raise coordination

We use minimum instead of average terrain ruggedness because the 
topography within Chinese counties is often highly heterogeneous. The average 
ruggedness can be skewed by large, uninhabitable mountainous areas, making 
it an unrepresentative measure of the land available for development. Minimum 
ruggedness, in contrast, better captures the topographical constraints on a 
county ’ s most developable land, where the land assembly we study is most 
likely to occur.

costs, act as a critical impediment to the reform ’ s success.
Second, we use the density of lineage genealogies of each county as a 
proxy for clan culture, where a denser clan network is thought to 
facilitate collective cooperation and coordination ( Chen et al., 2024 ; 
Greif and Tabellini, 2010 ). The results are reported in the next two 
columns in Table 3 , where Column (3) introduces a dummy variable 
indicating one when the number of genealogies per 10000 residents in a 
county is above the sample average and zero otherwise, while Column 
(4) utilizes the continuous specification. Column (3) shows that the re -
form ’ s effect centers in communities with a denser clan culture. Spe -
cifically, the continuous interaction term in Column (4) indicates that a 
one standard deviation increase in clan density amplifies the reform ’ s 
effect by an additional 34 firms.
These findings suggest that the success of the land reform is critically 
dependent on the collective ’ s coordination capacity. Previous literature 
has compellingly documented the land assembly problem in both 
developing and developed countries, where fragmented ownership and 
corresponding holdouts and transaction costs crowded out enterprises ’ 
enthusiasm for investments ( Haasbroek, 2025 ; Isaac et al., 2016 ). Our 
work shows that allocating land transfer rights to rural collectives offers 
a solution to this coordination failure. On one hand, rural collectives can 
internalize coordination costs among village members through 
vote-based collective negotiation. On the other hand, they can work as a 
bargaining representative with firms, leveraging both the authority 
derived from de jure land ownership and the legitimacy conferred by 
democratic elections ( Martinez-Bravo et al., 2022 ; Zhao, 2020 ). This 
coordination capacity, in turn, unlocks two specific channels for the rise 
of rural entrepreneurship, which we formally test in Section 4.4 .
4.2. Robustness checks
4.2.1. Parallel trends
Like all DID models, the validity of our strategy relies on the 
assumption of parallel trends, which posits that the treatment and 
control groups would have experienced similar enterprise growth trends 
in the absence of land reform. We test this assumption with an event 
study model as specified in equation (2) . Fig. 3 provides the pre-trend 
and dynamic effects based on equation (2) . Apart from the ordinary 
least squares estimator, we provide dynamic estimators robust to het -
erogeneous treatment effects based on De Chaisemartin and D ’ Hault -
f œ uille (2020) and Sun and Abraham (2021) .
13
Across the estimators, 
we consistently find significant growth in the number of enterprises 
during the post-reform period, while prior to the land reform, the co -
efficients are small in magnitude and nonsignificant, which supports the 
underlying parallel trend assumption.
We also test whether our OLS estimators are sensitive to violations of 
parallel trends, following Rambachan and Roth (2023) . Specifically, we 
compare the original confidence intervals of each post-reform coeffi -
cient against a set of robust confidence intervals. These robust intervals 
account for the uncertainty of the pre-trends and allow for 
period-specific departures from the linear trends up to the chosen 
smoothness parameter M. As shown in Appendix Figure C-3 , all 
post-reform coefficients are highly robust to a linear trend violation (M 
= 0). Notably, our results allow for M values up to 6.5, which is 
equivalent to 50% of the corresponding standard error for the coefficient 
of the first post-reform year (L_1).
4.2.2. Confounding policies
One central concern with our baseline findings derives from the 
concurrent policies enacted in rural China. During our sample period, 
rural China has witnessed several major policy initiatives aimed at 
promoting local economic growth. We identify three concurrent policies 
that could confound our results: (1) the nationwide Land Titling Reform 
(Land Titling), which starts from 2009 and aims to enhance individual ’ s 
agricultural land security ( Bu and Liao, 2022 ); (2) the Rural Returnees ’ 
Entrepreneurship Supportive Program (RRESP), launched in 341 
counties over three waves from 2016 to 2018, aiming to lower the 
institutional barriers for returnee entrepreneurs to engage in rural 
businesses, especially the rural E-Commerce; and (3) the Rural Housing 
Mortgage Program (Mortgage) introduced in 2016 that allows rural 
houses to be used as collateral for bank loans in 59 counties to improve 
rural access to credit. Detailed information on each confounding policy 
can be found in Appendix A-1 , which specifies their background,

implementation schedule, overlap with our sample, and the construction 
of the corresponding time-varying indicators used in our empirical 
analysis.
We employ a twofold empirical strategy to disentangle the effect of 
our land reform from these confounding policies. First, we test the 
robustness of our main finding by including time-varying indicators
14
for each of these policies as control variables in our baseline model. The 
results are presented in Panel A of Table 4 , where we incrementally 
introduce controls for each policy in Columns (1) to (3) and include 
three policies simultaneously in Columns (4). Across the specifications, 
the coefficients of our interest remain statistically significant, while the 
coefficients of the confounding policies are small in magnitude and 
nonsignificant, suggesting that the entrepreneurship growth we observe 
is primarily driven by land transferability reform itself, rather than the 
concurrent implementation of other policies.
Second, we go a step further by testing potential interactions to 
explore whether these policies act as complements or substitutes to the 
land reform. The results are presented in Panel B of Table 4 . Column (1) 
shows no significant interaction effect between the land transferability 
reform and the nationwide Land Titling program. This null effect does 
not imply that individual titling and collective transfer rights are theo -
retically independent. Rather, this result stems from China ’ s special land 
use system, under which the two sets of rights govern mutually exclusive 
categories of land. As we detailed in Appendix Table A-1 ,
15
our reform 
grants transferability to non-agricultural construction land controlled by 
rural collectives, while the titling reform enhances security for farmland 
allocated to rural households. Somewhat unexpectedly, we also find no 
significant interaction between the land reform and the RRESP, as 
shown in Column (2) of Panel B. A possible explanation for the similar 
null effect lies in RRESP ’ s focus on rural E-Commerce, much of which is 
exempt from mandatory business registration
16
and therefore is likely 
underrepresented in our dataset. In Column (3), we observe a positive 
and statistically significant interaction between our reform and the 
mortgage program. Specifically, in counties without the mortgage pol -
icy, the transferability reform ’ s effect is a modest 18.8. However, in 
counties where both reforms are active, the total effect surges to 77.3. 
Our findings suggest a synergic effect of relaxing frictions in both land 
and financial markets.
4.2.3. Spillovers
Another caveat for our design lies in the spillover effect, whereby 
entrepreneurship activities in the control group might be affected by the 
more desirable status of the treatment group nearby. Specifically, those 
who had intended to establish firms in control regions might have been 
attracted to land reform counties due to the advantages of doing busi -
ness there. If there are indeed such spillovers, our baseline findings 
might overestimate the advantages of land reform. Alternatively, our 
baseline results may underestimate the treatment effects if land reform 
counties can create new opportunities for suppliers or related service 
businesses in their neighbors. To test these potential spillovers, we 
incorporate two additional tests in Table 5 .
First, we follow the concentric ring design utilized by Lu et al. 
(2019) , eliminating a small number of neighboring counties directly 
adjacent to our treated group. This strategy is plausible because the

spillover is particularly salient in geographically adjacent control re -
gions, as they share similar entrepreneurial environments with the 
treatment groups, and the relocation costs for firms are cheaper. The 
results are shown in Column (1) of Table 5 , where the estimated co -
efficients remain significant and positive, with the magnitude closely 
aligned with our baseline estimates. Secondly, in Column (2), we follow 
Li et al. (2025) and include a time-varying dummy “ Neighbor Reform ” , 
which equals one for control county i in year t if any of its adjacent 
counties has implemented land reform and zero otherwise. The coeffi -
cient of Neighbor Reform is small and statistically insignificant, sug -
gesting that the land reform does not meaningfully affect the rural 
business creation in neighboring counties. In Columns (3) and (4), we 
account for neighboring counties that are located within the same pre -
fectural cities, which are likely to share more institutional and economic 
characteristics with the original treatment groups. The results are almost 
identical regardless of whether we exclude these intra-city neighbors in 
Column (3) or apply a similar dummy variable in Column (4). In other 
words, the enterprise growth we observe in land reform counties is 
unlikely to be biased by spillovers.
4.2.4. Other robustness checks
We further perform a series of other tests to illustrate the reliability 
of our findings. First, we introduce a placebo test as implemented by Li 
et al. (2016) and Cantoni et al. (2017) to exclude unobserved 
time-varying factors specific to each county (See Appendix Figure C-4 ). 
Second, we test the sensitivity of our results using alternative specifi -
cations in clustering methods, outcome definitions, empirical strategies, 
and alternative controls and sample structures. The results are shown in 
Appendix Table B-1 to Table B-3 . Specifically, in Table B-1 , we introduce 
different specifications of clustering methods. The results are almost 
identical when we cluster standard errors at the city, province, or use 
multi-way clustering at the county and province-by-year or county and 
city-by-year levels. We further test the sensitivity in our outcome spec -
ifications and empirical strategies. In Column (1) of Appendix Table B-2 , 
we utilize the logarithmic transformation of our original outcome vari -
able, while in Column (2), we introduce a Poisson regression model to 
account for the count nature of our dependent variable — the number of 
newly registered firms. Across these specifications, our core findings 
remain stable and robust. Finally, in Appendix Table B-3 , we introduce 
additional county-specific time trends and aggregate the sample into a 
county panel. The first two columns of Table B-3 show our baseline 
results and robustness after accounting for county-specific time trends.
17
In Columns (3) and (4), we aggregate the sample into a county panel and 
find a similar margin to our baseline results (28%). Taken together, our 
results are not sensitive to the specifications in outcome definitions, 
empirical strategies, alternative controls, and sample structure.
4.3. Heterogeneity
This section analyzes the growth patterns of rural firms by asking 
four questions: (1) what industries are growing? (2) what is the quality 
of these new ventures? (3) who are the entrepreneurs leading them? and 
(4) where is this growth geographically concentrated? Answering these 
questions not only characterizes the firm types and spatial distribution 
of the entrepreneurial boom but also offers suggestive evidence for the 
underlying mechanisms that we formally test in Section 4.4 .
4.3.1. Industrial type
We start with the industrial type of newly registered firms. The firms 
are aggregated by industrial type in each town-year cell. To account for 
the zero-inflated problem in industry-level firm entry, we employ a dual 
strategy. First, we aggregate industries into three broad sec -
tors
18
— agriculture, manufacturing, and services — and utilize OLS re -
gressions for a macro-overview ( Table 6 ). Second, to explore more 
granular dynamics, we leverage Poisson regression models on 18 finely 
disaggregated, one-digit industry classifications (Appendix Figure C-5 ).
Table 6 shows that the land transferability reform increases the 
number of manufacturing and service firms by 9% and 28%, respec -
tively. According to Appendix Fig. 4 , the growth of firms is concentrated 
in land-intensive heavy sectors such as manufacturing and mining, as 
well as a wide range of service industries, including retail, leasing, real 
estate service, research, education, and environmental management. 
This dual-track expansion provides suggestive evidence for two separate 
channels that we hypothesized in the institutional background. On the 
one hand, given the land and capital-intensive attributes of 
manufacturing firms, we suspect that the firm growth in this sector may 
be driven by investors who are able to acquire cheaper and consolidated 
contiguous land in land reform counties. On the other hand, the surge of 
service establishments is consistent with the story of wealth effect 
( Corradin and Popov, 2015 ; Hurst and Lusardi, 2004 ), where windfall 
land revenues can relax entrepreneurial liquidity constraints for local 
farmers to start low-barrier retail ventures, and simultaneously boost 
local consumption demand and stimulate entry in these non-tradable 
activities such as repair, leasing, real estate and education ( Hollenbeck 
and Giroldo, 2022 ; Sato et al., 2012 ). Additionally, the growth of new 
manufacturers may create demand for production-network comple -
mentarities, such as demand for R & D service and services for environ -
mental compliance ( Ellison et al., 2010 ).
We further aggregate the firms by their ownership attributes in Ap -
pendix Table B-4 . The results show that the growth of manufacturing 
and service firms is exclusively driven by private firms rather than state- 
owned firms, which have better access to state-owned rural land given 
their strong political connections ( Chen and Kung, 2019 ; Wang and 
Yang, 2021 ). Consistent with the global pattern of rural structural 
transformation away from agriculture ( Dippel et al., 2020 ; Fried and 
Lagakos, 2021 ), we also observe a decline in agricultural firms by 12% 
compared to the mean value of the outcome. This decline raises the 
concern that the observed positive entrepreneurship effects may come at 
the cost of agricultural recession. We will formally test the potential

The coefficient in Column (2) decreases from 33.442 to 17.065 after adding

4.3.2. Entrepreneurial quality
While previous sections have documented a significant increase in 
the quantity of new firms, one may wonder whether the reform also 
improved their quality. In this section, we test the quality of new firms 
induced by land reform from multiple aspects: organizational types, 
initial capital investments, and post-entry survival.
Our first evidence on quality is associated with the organizational 
structure of firms. There are three organizational types in China: 
farmers ’ professional cooperatives, self-employment, and formally 
registered firms.
19
Panel A of Table 7 shows an organizational structure 
shift away from traditional collective agricultural firms toward more 
market-oriented individual and corporate ventures. Specifically, the 
land reform increases the number of formal firms and self-employment 
businesses by 35% and 21% (Columns (1) and (2)), respectively. 
Consistent with the decline in agricultural firms, we observe a similar 
decrease of 17% in farmers ’ professional cooperatives that focus on 
agricultural services (Column (3)). This leap towards formalization 
marks an upgrade in enterprise quality, as formal firms tend to exhibit 
higher productivity, stronger scalability, and legal protections ( La Porta 
and Shleifer, 2014 ).
We next examine the size of new firms, proxied by their registered 
capital, which reflects the founder ’ s commitment to maximum liability 
and the venture ’ s initial scale. Following Bai et al. (2025) , we define 
firms with registered capital below RMB 2 million as small, and those 
exceeding RMB 15 million as large
20
.
As shown in Panel B of Table 7 , the reform significantly boosts the 
entry of both small firms (Column (1)) and large firms (Column (3)), 
with a null effect on medium-sized enterprises (Column (2)). The mag -
nitudes are substantial: the number of small firms rises by 32 percent, 
whereas large-scale entrants expand by 24 percent relative to their 
respective means. The growth of large firms mirrors the previously 
documented firm expansion in heavy industries, suggesting that the land 
reform can unlock capital-intensive investments by lowering land use 
costs of assembled contiguous plots. Our findings differ from earlier 
titling or collateral-based reforms, as they predominantly benefited 
micro-scale ventures or self-employment by relaxing liquidity con -
straints or labor mobility ( Bu and Liao, 2022 ; Field, 2007 ). Put differ -
ently, collective land transfer rights may remove land-market frictions 
that previously impeded high-stakes industrial entry, as rural collectives 
can better integrate the scattered land through collective negotiation to 
meet the demands of large enterprises.
Another attribute of firm quality lies in the post-entry performance. 
Three kinds of post-entry operational status are recorded in China ’ s 
enterprise registration system: surviving, deregistered, and relocated. 
Due to the lack of exact firm exit and relocation dates in our dataset, we 
classify firms registered in a given town-year based on their operational 
status as of 2022. The results are reported in Panel C of Table 7 , where 
we observe evidence against the story of registration boom for low- 
viability, short-lived ventures ( Branstetter et al., 2014 ). Instead, the 
land reform encourages a large and statistically significant increase 
(about 31%) in the number of firms surviving until 2022 (Column (1)). 
At the same time, we observe null effects on deregistered and relocated 
firms (Columns (1) and (2)). Our results imply that the marginal entrant 
induced by land reform appears to be high-quality firms with long-term 
survival.
4.3.3. Gender difference of entrepreneur
We further test whether the effects of land reform vary across male 
and female-led enterprises. Theoretically, the effect of our land reform 
on the gender gap in entrepreneurship is ambiguous. On the one hand, 
the reform could disproportionately benefit female entrepreneurs, who 
typically face more severe credit constraints ( Asiedu et al., 2012 ; Ewens 
and Townsend, 2020 ), if the land revenues distributed by the collective 
relax binding liquidity constraints. On the other hand, the reform could 
reinforce existing inequalities or even widen the gender gap. If 
male-dominated village collectives distribute proceeds inequitably, or if 
the primary benefits of lower land costs accrue to capital-intensive, 
male-dominated sectors, then men would be the main beneficiaries.

Note: This table presents the heterogeneity effects on rural entrepreneurship 
across different measures of firm quality. The outcome variable of this table is 
the number of newly registered enterprises of each type aggregated at the town- 
year level. Panel A shows the results on organizational status, while Panel B 
shows the results on firm size, proxied by registered capital. We provide results 
on post-entry performance in Panel C, which records the firm ’ s operational 
status as of year 2022. There are 34% and 0.1% firms in our sample lacking 
registered capital and operational status. We test whether the attrition is 
correlated with treatment status in Columns (1) and (2) of Appendix Table B-5 .

Farmers ’ professional cooperatives are collective mutual-aid organizations 
focusing on agricultural services. Self-employment represents individual pro -
prietorships or small businesses with low entry barriers, typically started by 
local residents. Formal firms are other legally incorporated entities (e.g., LLCs) 
with a structure suitable for scaling, established by either local or outside 
investors.
20
One concern with our identification lies in the sizeable share of observa -
tions lacking registered-capital information (about 34%). To test whether the 
attrition is systematically related to our treatment, we regress the number of 
firms with missing information on registered capital on the land reform indi -
cator in Appendix Table B-5 . Column 1 shows that the coefficient on the reform 
variable is small and statistically insignificant, alleviating concerns of selective 
attrition. We run the same test for the tiny fraction of firms without survival 
status (0.1 %) and predicted entrepreneur gender (0.5 %) in Columns (2) and 
(3) and likewise obtain economically negligible and statistically insignificant 
estimates

Given these competing channels, we hold no strong prior on the net 
direction of the effect and turn to the data.
Table 8 reports the results, where we aggregate new firms of each 
town-year cell by the predicted gender of entrepreneurs across different 
industrial sectors. Columns (1) and (2) suggest that the reform’s impact 
is not strongly biased at the aggregate level, as it simultaneously boosts 
the entry of male and female-led firms by 24% and 29%. This aggregate 
result, however, may mask gender-based sorting across different in -
dustrial sectors. The decline in agricultural enterprises, for instance, is 
driven almost entirely by a reduction in male-owned firms (Columns (3) 
and (4)), suggesting a reallocation of male entrepreneurs away from 
traditional low-return farming-related businesses. Columns (5) to (8) 
further report the gender heterogeneity in manufacturing and service 
sectors. We observe that the reform spurs male-led entry in both 
manufacturing and service industries, whereas female-led firms only 
increase in the service sector with low start-up costs ( Wang et al., 2024 ). 
This gender difference is plausible because manufacturing ventures 
demand substantial fixed capital and collateral, which therefore benefits 
male entrepreneurs who already possess, or can more easily mobilize, 
financial resources and production networks. Our findings are consistent 
with broader literature on gendered financial constraints ( Asiedu et al., 
2012 ; Ewens and Townsend, 2020 ) as well as cross-country evidence on 
how land-related income can empower women to engage in non-farm 
businesses ( Efobi et al., 2019 ).
4.3.4. Spatial distribution of the growing firms
Having profiled the firm types that underline the observed expan -
sion, we next investigate the spatial distribution of the firm growth 
based on a town’s standardized distance to its county government, a 
proxy for access to entrepreneurial complements such as better infra -
structure and market connectivity ( Kim and Orazem, 2017 ). The results 
are presented in Table 9 , where Columns (1) and (2) show the aggregate 
effect on all new firms, while Columns (3) to (5) unpack the sectoral 
decomposition. As shown in Column (1), the reform’s positive effect is 
significantly weaker for remote towns whose distance to the county 
government is larger than the sample average. The continuous interac -
tion in Column (2) further confirms the magnitude of the distance decay: 
a one standard deviation increase in the town-county distance reduces 
the reform’s positive effect by 12.3 firms. The sectoral decomposition in 
Columns (3) to (5) reveals that the overall distance decay is driven by 
the service sector, rather than manufacturing or agricultural firms.
Two reasons can explain this spatial heterogeneity. First, land 
transaction values are typically highest near urban centers ( Albouy 
et al., 2018 ; Alonso, 1964 ). Consequently, land transfers in these areas 
would generate larger achievable land wealth, equipping households 
with more substantial seed capital and easier liquidity constraints. 
Secondly, central locations likely possess superior entrepreneurial 
complements such as better infrastructure and market connectivity ( Kim 
and Orazem, 2017 ), which can amplify the benefits of entrepreneurship 
by enhancing resource complementarities, especially for service sectors 
that are highly sensitive to consumer demand and market access 
( Hollenbeck and Giroldo, 2022 ; Sato et al., 2012 ). Additionally, this 
spatial distribution implies that while the reform successfully unlocks 
new ventures, it may simultaneously exacerbate spatial inequality be -
tween core and peripheral regions within a county. This regional 
inequality is possibly driven by the disproportionately concentrated 
urbanization-induced demand.
4.4. Mechanisms
Our analysis has so far established that the land transferability re -
form spurred dual-track entrepreneurial growth in large, capital- 
intensive ventures and small self-employment businesses. In this sec -
tion, we formally test the causal channels behind the firm growth. As 
illustrated in Section 4.1.2 , the reform’s success first hinges on the 
village collective’s capacity to solve a fundamental land coordination 
problem. When this coordination is successful, it then unlocks two 
powerful downstream channels: a land use cost channel that benefits 
firms, and a land wealth channel that empowers local residents. We test 
each component of this causal chain in turn.
4.4.1. Land use costs
Our first and most important downstream channel unlocked by 
effective collective coordination is associated with lower land use costs. 
From an industrial organization perspective, the land transferability 
reform introduces price competition into the previously monopolistic 
rural land market. Before the reform, local governments were the sole 
legal suppliers of land for business purposes. The coordination ability of 
rural collectives allows them to bring large-scale, comparable land 
parcels to the market, making the rural collective a competitive land 
supplier after the reform. Previous literature has elaborated on how 
price is adjusted in the context of competition ( Bloom and Van Reenen, 
2007 ; Shapiro and Varian, 1999 ; Stahl, 1988 ). For example, Bertrand’s 
competition model argues that competition on price, providing that 
goods are perfect substitutes, ends with firms selling their goods at 
marginal costs, thus making zero profits. As a result, this new supplier 
entry is expected to exert downward pressure on the equilibrium price of 
land, which in turn lowers the entry barrier (e.g., fixed land use costs), 
particularly for land-intensive ventures.
We test our hypotheses using extensive state-owned land transaction 
records located in rural regions, given the access restriction on trans -
action records of collectively-owned rural land. The results are reported 
in Table 10 . Columns (1) to (3) report the reform’s impact on logarith -
mic average land transaction unit prices aggregated at the town-year 
level, where observations are treated as missing for town-years 
without any state-owned land transactions. To isolate the reform’s net 
impact from potential composition bias attributed to land quality and 
locational heterogeneity, we construct quality-adjusted land prices 
using a random forest model developed by Grange et al. (2018) (See 
Appendix A-2 ). Column (1) provides direct evidence of lower land use 
costs for potential entrepreneurs: we observe a significant 19.4% 
decrease in state-owned land prices in towns within land reform 
counties. Columns (2) to (3) further reveal that the price reduction is 
almost entirely driven by land sold to land-intensive industries, such as 
manufacturing, mining, electricity, and construction, rather than other 
industries. This asymmetric distribution effect strengthens our story of 
coordination costs, as these sectors are more sensitive to coordination 
frictions due to huge and unavoidable fixed costs on contiguous land 
acquisition ( Haasbroek, 2025 ).
We further provide evidence on market volumes by aggregating the 
raw counts and total areas of transacted land parcels in each town-year 
cell. Theoretically, the prediction for the transaction volume effect on 
state-owned land is context dependent. On the one hand, a lower equi -
librium price should stimulate overall demand from firms, potentially 
increasing total market transactions (market expansion effect). On the 
other hand, the entry of a new competitor—the village collective— -
should capture a portion of the market, reducing the state’s market share 
(market-share-stealing effect). The net effect on the volume of state- 
owned land transactions may depend on the magnitudes of the two 
opposing effects. Columns (4) and (5) report the results, where we find 
no statistically significant effect on either the number of transacted 
state-owned land parcels or their total area. This null effect suggests that 
the market expansion and the market-share-stealing effect may either be 
roughly equal in magnitude, or that reform’s primary competitive 
impact, at least in the short term, is felt on the price margin rather than 
the quantity margin. Additionally, the unit price reduction and stable 
transaction volumes indicate a potential cost of the reform: a possible 
decline in fiscal revenue for local governments from state-owned land 
transactions. But since local governments can earn an additional 20-50% 
from collectively owned land transactions, as we illustrated in Section 2 , 
the aggregate effects on fiscal pressure rely on more rigorous empirical 
evidence.

4.4.2. Land wealth effects
Our second hypothetical channel derives from the land-induced 
wealth effects. Since collective land transfer rights solve the coordina -
tion failure problems for rural collectives, they facilitate the transfer of 
previously idle land to firms, thereby converting illiquid land assets into 
realizable wealth for communities and their members. Intuitively, this 
wealth shock can directly encourage local farmers to start businesses, 
especially in service sectors with lower entry barriers, as it provides seed 
capital that can relax the liquidity constraints in an imperfect credit 
market ( Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006 ; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989 ; Wang 
et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, the increased property income may 
indirectly attract investors to rural regions, given the increased demand 
for non-tradable local goods and services ( Gan, 2010 ; Lettau and Lud -
vigson, 2004 ), or the better business environments driven by wealthier 
collectives ’ public facility investments.
We first test the direct wealth channel using detailed information on 
rural households ’ income and residents ’ entrepreneurial decisions from 
the CHFS dataset. Rural residents in our study are defined as working- 
age individuals (aged 18 – 64) who hold a rural hukou prior to the re -
form. This restriction is grounded in China ’ s institutional background: 
the collective land revenues are exclusively distributed among members 
who hold a rural hukou, while residents without a rural hukou, even if 
they live in villages, are not eligible to share the land-related revenue. 
Table 11 reports empirical results, where the first two columns test the 
effect of reform on household land income, while Columns (3) to (6) 
shift the focus to individuals ’ entrepreneurial decisions. If a causal link

between land income and entrepreneurship exists, we would expect to 
observe a stronger entrepreneurial response among residents in areas 
poised to receive higher land income. Conversely, we should not observe 
a similar entrepreneurial pattern among residents who, for exogenous 
reasons, are excluded from these wealth benefits.
As our expectation, we observe a significant land income growth by 
909 RMB per household in Column (1) — about 121% compared with the 
sample average. Recalling the distance decay observed in Section 4.3.4 , 
we introduce in Column (2) an interaction term between the land reform 
and a dummy variable for remote villages to test the potential spatial 
heterogeneity. Consistent with our previous expectations, we find that 
the growing land wealth is significantly weaker for households living in 
remote villages. Specifically, rural households living in non-remote 
villages (i.e., small towns and near urban centers) see their land in -
come rise by approximately 2098 RMB, an amount over six times greater 
than the modest 304 RMB observed in remote villages. Our findings 
align with the land price gradients documented in urban economics 
( Albouy et al., 2018 ; Alonso, 1964 ), in which the revenues of land closer 
to urban centers are typically higher due to higher demand induced by 
better access to markets and infrastructure.
Columns (3) and (4) further establish the impact of land reform on 
individuals ’ entrepreneurial decisions. The outcome variable is a 
dummy indicating one if a rural hukou holder reports entrepreneur as 
his or her primary occupation for a given year. Column (3) shows that 
the average effect of the reform on local individuals ’ entrepreneurship is 
small and statistically insignificant when pooling all villagers together. 
However, after accounting for spatial heterogeneity in Column (4), we 
find that the land reform significantly boosts the probability of indi -
vidual entrepreneurship in non-remote villages by 6.5 percentage points 
(about a 59% increase compared to the sample average). Mirroring the 
income results, the entrepreneurship effect is wiped out in remote vil -
lages where the land-wealth shock is negligible and complementary 
market services are scarce. This consistent spatial pattern between land 
wealth and entrepreneurial activities provides compelling evidence for 
the direct wealth-driven channel, as the entrepreneurial activity re -
sponds only where households actually receive sizable land revenues.
To strengthen the causality between land income and entrepre -
neurship, we introduce two strategies. First, we conduct a placebo test 
using the entrepreneurial decision of urban residents without rural 
hukou as outcome variables. These urban residents serve as a credible 
placebo group because, while they are exposed to the same local eco -
nomic conditions as rural residents, they are legally ineligible to receive 
any financial benefits from the land transfer. Therefore, if the wealth 
channel holds, the reform should have no significant effect on their 
entrepreneurial choices. Columns (5) and (6) report the results, where 
we find no significant average effect on urban entrepreneurship, and 
critically, this null result holds even when accounting for spatial het -
erogeneity in Column (6), as both the main effect and the interaction 
term are statistically insignificant. This pattern mitigates the concerns 
about unobserved confounders and reinforce our interpretation that the 
effect on rural entrepreneurship, observed specifically in non-remote 
villages, is attributable to the specific wealth channel of the reform. 
We also provide a composition test in Appendix Table B-7 to rule out the 
potential reverse causality that the land income growth is driven by 
existing entrepreneurs or landlords who rent their land or properties to 
grow land income. Since we only have main entrepreneurship industries 
for each household, this test is performed at the household level. The 
results show that the entrepreneurship pattern is entirely driven by other 
industries unrelated to property management, which helps to alleviate 
the concerns of reverse causality.
Secondly, we explore two potential indirect wealth channels through 
which the reform could foster entrepreneurship: the consumption and 
facility-driven channels. In addition to being directly used to start a 
business, the increased land wealth may also stimulate households ’ 
consumption demand for local goods and services ( Gan, 2010 ; Lettau 
and Ludvigson, 2004 ), thereby attracting potential entrepreneurs to 
serve the growing rural markets. We test this hypothesis using house -
hold consumption records in Panel A of Table 12 . As expected, we 
observe significant consumption growth in clothes and education, which 
aligns with our findings regarding the expansion of retail and 
education-related businesses outlined in Appendix Figure C-5 .
Another interpretation of the land wealth effect is related to collec -
tive investments in public infrastructure and facilities. In rural China, 
village collectives are responsible for “ last-mile ” public goods in -
vestments and often raise funds from existing collective assets or among 
their members to fill the fiscal gap left by centralized government 
funding ( Xu and Yao, 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2004 ). The wealthier rural 
collectives may allocate their increased land revenue toward improving 
village infrastructure and facilities, which may attract new entrepre -
neurs given the improved business environments. Panel B of Table 12
tests this hypothesis using a series of satellite-observed indicators

of various facility POIs aggregated at the town-year level. We find no 
evidence that the rural collectives systemically increased investments in 
infrastructure and public facilities following the reform, as the co -
efficients of land reform are small and statistically indistinguishable 
from zero across all four columns. The null effects can be explained from 
several perspectives. First, and most likely, rural households in the 
context of high liquidity constraints often prefer direct cash transfers 
than from in-kind or public provisions ( Cunha, 2014 ). Second, the scale

of the revenue increase, while significant, may simply be insufficient to 
fund costly, large-scale infrastructure projects. Combined with the 
findings in Panel A, our results support the likelihood of 
consumption-driven rather than facility-driven entrepreneurship.
4.5. Further discussion
4.5.1. Potential costs on the agricultural sector
Our finding that the reform led to a decline in the number of regis -
tered agricultural enterprises ( Table 6 ) raises a potential concern: the 
observed entrepreneurial boom may have come at the cost of an agri -
cultural recession. This concern, however, can be alleviated through two 
institutional features of the collective land transferability reform. First, 
as we emphasized in the institutional background, the reform we study 
primarily targets collective operating construction land, which is legally 
and spatially distinct from the cropland allocated to households in pre- 
determined land use planning. Second, even in cases where land as -
sembly for new ventures requires the occupation of cropland, the village 
collective is mandated to follow China ’ s requisition-compensation bal -
ance policy issued in 1991 by reclaiming an equivalent area of cropland 
elsewhere designated for construction. Therefore, we anticipate that the 
reform ’ s direct impact on agricultural production should be limited.
We formally test our anticipation through three distinct datasets: 
town-level satellite-observed cropland area, individual-level agricul -
tural employment status, and county-level self-report agricultural out -
puts. The results, presented in Table 13 , alleviate concerns about an 
absolute agricultural decline. We find no statistically significant effect 
on either the total cropland area (Column (1)), the probability that rural 
residents are primarily engaged in agriculture (Column (2)), or agri -
cultural outputs for primary food crops, including total yields, planting 
area, and yields per planting area (Columns (3) to (5)). These consistent 
findings indicate that the reform does not lead to a broad reallocation of 
land or a wholesale exit of labor away from the agricultural sector. The 
previously observed decline in the number of new agricultural firms is 
likely to reflect a reallocation of entrepreneur talent from lower-return 
commercial farming toward higher-return opportunities in the non- 
agricultural sector, driven by the reform-induced surge in local de -
mand for non-tradable commodities and services.
4.5.2. Transformation of the rural employment structure
In this section, we move beyond entrepreneurship to investigate 
whether the land reform precipitate a more profound transformation in 
the rural employment structure. Table 14 provides empirical evidence 
on the employment status of the rural working-age population between 
18 and 64. The odd-numbered columns report the average effects, while 
the even columns introduce an interaction term with a male indicator to 
test for potential gender differences. As indicated by Columns (1) and 
(3), rural residents in the land reform counties are less likely to report 
unemployment and more likely to be employed by an enterprise 
following the reform compared with their counterparts living in control 
counties.
The expansion in wage-employment can be explained at least from 
two perspectives. First, on the demand side, the entry of new firms 
induced by the land reform, especially in the manufacturing sector, can 
create new wage job opportunities for local residents ( Jensen, 2012 ; 
Zhao and Qu, 2024 ). Second, the wealth generated from land transfers 
can relax liquidity constraints and searching costs that previously 
inhibited rural residents from non-farm wage jobs ( Chernina et al., 
2014 ; Chetty, 2008 ). Unlike the substitution effects observed in previous 
literature on positive wealth shocks and labor supply ( Li et al., 2020 ), 
our results indicate that transitory income can also be used to overcome 
financial barriers in searching for wage jobs, in particular in the context 
of imperfect rural credit and insurance markets. Our findings echo the 
evidence from Chernina et al. (2014) , who find that the improvements in 
land liquidity can finance internal rural-urban migration in Russia.
We further test the employment gender difference in the even- 
number columns. The insignificant interaction term in Column (2)

shows no significant gender difference in the growth of wage-job 
participation: both men and women in land reform counties experi -
ence a comparable increase in paid employment after the land reform. 
However, the sectors from which these additional wage workers are 
reallocated differ by gender. The significantly positive interaction term 
in Column (4) indicates that female workers tend to shift from unem -
ployment to wage jobs, while the negative interaction term in Column 
(6) shows that male workers are more likely to exit lower-return 
farming. This sectoral asymmetry mirrors their baseline occupational 
positions in rural China. In our sample, 21% of women are out of work 
before the land reform, which is double that of men (8%). Previous 
literature attributes this gap to heavier housework, caregiving duties, 
fertility, and the lack of female-friendly labor market opportunities 
( Chen and Ge, 2018 ; Goldin and Katz, 2002 ; Shi et al., 2024 ). The land 
reform, by generating flexible local non-farm job opportunities, may 
enable women to achieve a better work-family balance by entering local 
labor market without migrating far from home.

5. Conclusion
Understanding the determinants of rural entrepreneurship is crucial 
for tackling global rural poverty ( Alvarez and Barney, 2014 ; Bruton 
et al., 2013 ). This study focuses on a less noticed but vital barrier for 
rural entrepreneurship: fragmented land tenure and corresponding 
transaction costs to assemble land for modern enterprises. In the context 
of an ambitious land reform in China, we find that collective land 
transfer rights can lower land coordination costs and encourage rural 
entrepreneurship. Specifically, towns subjected to the land reform 
observe a significant 25% increase in the number of newly registered 
rural firms compared with the control group. As we expected, the in -
crease in rural firms is concentrated in regions with better collective 
coordination capacity (i.e., low-rugged areas and areas with denser clan 
networks) and is almost fully offset in regions where coordination is 
difficult to achieve.
Both land and capital-intensive firms in manufacturing and small 
firms in the service sectors experience growth following the land reform. 
We posit two different channels to explain this dual-track firm growth 
driven by collective land transfer rights: (1) lower land use costs for 
firms, and (2) higher land wealth for local residents. We first find that 
land use prices decrease by 19%, given the emergence of competing 
rural land suppliers ( Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007 ; Shapiro and Varian, 
1999 ; Stahl, 1988 ). The price reduction is driven by land-intensive in -
dustries, which are more sensitive to coordination frictions as land 
acquisition constitutes a large and unavoidable fixed cost ( Haasbroek, 
2025 ). Additionally, successful land transfer to firms helps convert 
illiquid land assets into realizable wealth for rural collectives and their 
members. This positive wealth shock, on one hand, promotes rural 
residents living near town and urban regions to directly start business, 
on the other hand, attracts new investors given the significant increase 
of household expenditure in non-tradable goods and services. Beyond 
entrepreneurship, the reform also contributes to the expansion of 
non-farm wage jobs, primarily attributed to more active labor market 
participation rather than the absolute decline of the agricultural sector.
Our work echoes a long-standing debate on the efficiency of private 
versus communal rights. While a large number of studies favor indi -
vidual rights for their clear incentives and allocative efficiency, 
communal or collective rights, in some cases, can be superior, such as 
welfare allocation and sustainable long-term use ( Besley and Ghatak, 
2010 ; Chankrajang, 2019 ; Ostrom and Hess, 2010 ; Zhao, 2020 ). 
Grounded in China ’ s ambitious land reform that allocates land transfer 
rights to rural collectives, our work highlights the value of collective 
rights and collective negotiation in solving coordination costs and 
holdout problems. This implication suggests that who holds the transfer 
rights — and at what level of aggregation — can be as pivotal as the right 
security itself.
Two findings from our analysis may merit further investigation. 
First, concerning the policy ’ s distributive consequences, our results 
show that the positive impact of collective transfer rights is far more 
pronounced for towns proximate to urban centers. This disparity high -
lights a need for future work to focus on the within-county distribution, 
examining how the gains from this reform are shared between different 
communities. Second, our research suggests a potential reduction in 
land-based revenue for local governments, as we observe a decreased 
land unit price and stable transaction volume for state-owned land. 
Future research can explore how local governments adapt to these fiscal 
pressures: for instance, whether they alter their land supply strategies, 
seek alternative revenue sources, or change their patterns of public 
service provision in response to the shifting land market dynamics.

Appendix 
Appendix A. Other Details
A-1: Details of Confounding Policies
In this section, we introduce the details of each concurrent policy that may confound our baseline results. For each policy, we describe its 
background, implementation schedule, overlap with our sample, and the construction of the corresponding time-varying indicator used in our 
empirical analysis. 
(1) Nationwide Land Titling Reform
The Land Titling Reform is a major nationwide initiative aimed at strengthening rural households’ land tenure security by issuing formal cer -
tificates for their contracted farmland. The reform was rolled out progressively by the Ministry of Agriculture in four main phases: (1) 2009–2010, 
initial village-level pilots; (2) 2011–2013, expanded pilots at the township level across several hundred counties; (3) 2014, launch of whole-province 
pilots in three provinces; and (4) post-2014, expansion of the whole-province pilot model to an additional nine provinces, eventually aiming for 
nationwide coverage by the end of 2018.
Due to limitations in the accessibility of historical government websites, we were only able to obtain the list of counties and their specific 
implementation years from 2013 onwards. This limitation is unlikely to significantly bias our results, as Bu and Liao (2022) note that only about 0.2% 
of counties had completed the titling process before 2013. Given that the titling reform has been rolled out nationwide during our sample period, all 
counties in our sample were eventually targeted. To account for the effects of land titling, we construct a time-varying indicator, “Land Titling”, which 
equals one for each county in all years during and after the year when it officially implemented the titling reform, and zero otherwise.
One may easily conflate the two reforms, as land titling and the reform of our focus are both related to rural land property rights. However, they 
differ in property rights nature, targeted land assets, and theoretical mechanisms that may affect rural entrepreneurship. As shown in Table A-1 , in 
essence, the two reforms represent the fundamental divide between private and communal land rights. The Land Titling reform aims to improve 
individuals’ tenure security over their contracted agricultural land, while the transferability reform aims to improve land market efficiency by 
allocating construction land transfer rights to rural collectives.
Specifically, there are three-dimensional differences between the two reforms. (1) The nature of property rights. Land titling focuses on security, 
while our reform focuses on transferability or alienability of property rights. (2) Target land assets. In China, the two reforms operate on adminis -
tratively distinct and non-overlapping land categories: the titling reform focuses on contracted agricultural land, whereas the transferability reform 
focuses on non-agricultural construction land. This non-overlap attribute limits the scope for direct interaction between the two reforms. While one 
might easily consider that collective transfer rights and individual tenure are to some extent in tension, strengthening titles on farmland does not 
mechanically diminish collective control over other construction lands. (3) Mechanisms for entrepreneurship. The distinction in specific rights and 
rights holders naturally leads to different mechanisms through which the two land reforms may affect entrepreneurship. Specifically, the Land Titling 
reform may encourage small-scale and home-based businesses by freeing up household labor for off-farm work or improving access to land-related 
credit for individual farmers. The land transferability reform, however, can solve land assembly problems through collective negotiation and 
lower contiguous land use costs for large firms.
Building on these insights, our work adds to the literature on property rights and development from two aspects. First, we shift the spotlight from 
the extensively studied tenure-security to the transferability margin of property rights. A large body of work shows that secure titles raise investment 
and productivity ( Besley, 1995 ; Jacoby et al., 2002 ; Deininger and Jin, 2006 ; Bu and Liao, 2022 ). Yet, security alone does not guarantee efficient use: 
when rights are non-tradable, the secure and clearly-defined rights can still yield factor misallocation by locking land into original landowners ( Jin and 
Deininger, 2009 ; Besley and Ghatak, 2010 ; Adamopoulos and Restuccia, 2020 ). In particular, when the initial assignment of rights is imperfect—or 
lags behind shifts in comparative advantage and market conditions—these non-transferable titles entrench an outdated allocation, preventing land 
from moving to higher-productivity individuals or higher-return activities. Our results, building on a reform that relaxes the transferability over land 
previously subject to transfer restrictions, provide direct evidence on how enhancing transferability can mitigate this misallocation, unlock "dead 
capital" ( De Soto, 2000 ), and subsequently spur entrepreneurship and local economic growth.
Our work echoes a long-standing debate on the efficiency of private versus communal rights. While a large number of studies favor individual 
rights for their clear incentives and allocative efficiency, communal or collective rights, in some cases, can be superior, such as welfare allocation, and 
sustainable long-term use ( Besley and Ghatak, 2010 ; Chankrajang, 2019 ; Ostrom and Hess, 2010 ; Zhao, 2020 ). Grounded in China’s ambitious land 
reform that allocates land transfer rights to rural collectives, our work highlights the value of collective rights and collective negotiation in solving 
coordination costs and holdout problems. This implication suggests that who holds the transfer rights—and at what level of aggregation—can be as 
pivotal as the right security itself.

(2) The Rural Returnees’ Entrepreneurship Supportive Program
The Rural Returnees’ Entrepreneurship Supportive Program (RRESP) is a pilot program designed to foster a favorable entrepreneurial ecosystem 
for returnees, focusing on improving the institutional environment rather than providing direct subsidies. The program was rolled out in three main 
waves across a total of 341 pilot counties: the first batch of 90 counties in 2016,
21
the second batch of 116 counties in 2017,
22
and the third batch of 
135 counties in 2018.
23
Our full sample contains 101 of these RRESP pilot counties. However, the overlap with our land reform treatment group is minimal, with only 9 
treatment counties also being part of the returnee program. To test whether our results are driven by the RRESP, we create a time-varying indicator, 
RRESP, which equals one for a designated pilot county in all years during and after its specific implementation wave (2016, 2017, or 2018), and zero 
otherwise. For all non-pilot counties, this variable is always zero. 
(3) The Rural Housing Mortgage Program
To improve rural access to credit, the central government launched a pilot program in 2016 that allowed rural households in 59 designated 
counties to use their residential properties (houses) as collateral for bank loans.
24
This policy has a significant overlap with our study. Our sample includes 29 of these pilot counties, 23 of which are also in our land reform 
treatment group. This high degree of overlap makes it a particularly important policy to account for. Specifically, we create a time-varying indicator, 
Mortgage, which equals one for a designated pilot county for all years from 2016 onwards, and zero otherwise.
A-2 Land Price Prediction Grounded in Random Forest
We follow the methodology of Grange et al. (2018) to obtain comparable land prices across different regions. The specific procedures for training 
the random forest model are outlined below:
First, we train the random forest model to capture the potential association between land price and predictors. Our predictors include three types of 
variables: (1) Land characteristics such as land use type, grade, transaction mode, plot ratio, area, source, and distance to the prefecture-level city 
center and the county center. (2) Cyclical factors. We contain a cyclical predictor, which determines the specific day of the year when the land 
transaction date occurs, to account for the variation in land prices due to the cyclical nature of economic activities. (3) Variables that uniquely identify 
every parcel of land. We include a variable (unix_id) that can define each land parcel to identify the actual land price after isolating land characteristics 
and cyclical factors. We randomly divided land transaction data from 2009 to 2019 into a training set (80% of the sample data) and a test set (20% of 
the sample data). The training set is used to construct a random forest model by randomly extracting a certain number of sample units and generating 
300 decision trees. The minimum unit of each leaf node is five, and the number of variables that each node may use for segmentation is equal to the 
square root of the total number of predictors.
Second, after completing the model training, we generate multiple land value predictions by randomly assigning predictors and then calculate the 
real land price by taking the mean value. For each prediction, we randomly select land characteristics and cyclical factors from the original data while 
keeping the unique land identifier (unix_id) constant. This procedure enables us to determine the predicted land value by considering the randomly 
assigned land characteristics and cyclical factors, all while maintaining the fundamental attributes of the land parcels. We iterate the aforementioned 
process 300 times and calculate the mean of all the predicted values to determine standardized land prices that isolate locational attributes.

Note: This figure plots the event study coefficients based on the method from Borusyak et al. (2024) and Callaway and Sant ’ Anna (2021) , where the dependent 
variable consists of the annual number of registered enterprises for a given town. The regression model controls province-by-year and town fixed effects. The vertical 
lines represent 95% confidence intervals for the respective point estimates.
C-3: Sensitivity Test for Parallel Trends
Figure C-3 shows the sensitivity analysis results for non-parallel trends, following Rambachan and Roth (2023) . Specifically, we compare the 
original confidence intervals of each post-reform coefficient against a set of robust confidence intervals. These robust intervals account for the un -
certainty of the pre-trends and allow for period-specific departures from the linear trends up to the chosen smoothness parameter M. As shown in 
Appendix Figure C-3 , all post-reform coefficients are highly robust to a linear trend violation (M = 0). Notably, our results allow for M values up to 6.5, 
which is equivalent to 50% of the corresponding standard error for the coefficient of the first post-reform year (L_1).
Fig. C-3. Sensitivity Analysis for Non-Parallel Trends: Smoothness Restrictions 
Note: The figures plot 95% robust confidence intervals of each post-reform coefficient specified in equation (2) , following the approach of smoothness restrictions 
proposed by Rambachan and Roth (2023) . The red bar represents the 95% confidence interval of each post-reform OLS estimate as displayed in Fig. 3 . Blue bars 
represent the corresponding 95% fixed-length confidence intervals when allowing for per-period violations of parallel trends of up to M. M = 0 corresponds to 
allowing a linear trend. M > 0 allows for increasingly more varied nonlinear trends.
C-4: Placebo Tests
We introduce a placebo test, as implemented by Li et al. (2016) and Cantoni et al. (2017) , to rule out the influence of unobserved time-varying

factors specific to each county. Specifically, we randomly select two rounds of reform counties from the 666 counties within the sample area to 
constitute a fake treatment group, implement the DID model in equation (1) , and repeat this process 500 times. According to Figure C-4 , the co -
efficients obtained from the fake treatment groups are predominantly insignificant at a 90% confidence level and centered around zero, a value 
considerably distant from the baseline result of 33. Our finding implies that the original results (significant positive coefficients) are unlikely to be 
driven by other unobserved confounding factors.

Note: The figure shows the cumulative distribution density and P-value of the estimated coefficients from 500 simulations randomly assigning treated status to 
counties. The vertical line presents the baseline result of Column 1 in Table 2 .
C-5: Heterogeneity by Specific Industrial Type (Poisson Regression)
Fig. C-5. Heterogeneity by Industrial Type Note: This figure shows the heterogeneity in firm growth across 18 one-digit industrial types. The outcome variable of this 
figure is the raw number of newly registered enterprises of each industry aggregated at the town-year level. We utilize Poisson regression to account for the zero- 
inflated problem and control for town and province-by-year fixed effects in each specification. The vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals for the respective 
point estimates.
