# Obsidian Dataview Summarizer Skill

## Description
This skill processes the 7 sub-part Markdown files (1_Overview.md to 7_Critique.md) generated by the Deep Reading Agent.
It uses DeepSeek to analyze the content of each file, extracting key sub-sections (e.g., "Research Theme", "Hypothesis", "Data Source") and summarizing them into single-sentence values.
These summaries are then injected into the YAML Frontmatter of each file as key-value pairs, enabling powerful cross-note querying and summarization using Obsidian Dataview.

## Usage
Run the script `run_dataview_summarizer.ps1` with the path to the `deep_reading_results` directory.

```powershell
.\run_dataview_summarizer.ps1 "d:\code\skill\deep_reading_results"
```

## Logic
1. Iterate through files `1_Overview.md` to `7_Critique.md`.
2. For each file:
   a. Read the content (excluding existing YAML).
   b. Send content to DeepSeek with a prompt to:
      - Identify semantic sections (based on bolded headers or numbered lists).
      - Summarize each section into a concise 1-sentence string (Chinese).
      - Generate English keys for these sections (e.g., `research_theme`, `data_source`).
      - Return a JSON object.
   c. Update the file's YAML frontmatter with these new keys.
   d. Preserve existing metadata (Title, Authors, etc.).
